## Implementation Notes

### Assessment Flow

1. **Initial Assessment (CORE)**
   - All users complete 80 CORE questions
   - Includes demographics, basic sleep metrics, and gateway triggers
   - Estimated time: 15-20 minutes

2. **Gateway Evaluation**
   - 11 gateway questions embedded in CORE assessment
   - Responses automatically determine which expansion modules to deploy
   - Smart triggering reduces average patient burden

3. **Expansion Modules (Conditional)**
   - 179 total expansion questions available
   - Average user completes 40-60 expansion questions
   - Only relevant modules triggered based on gateway responses
   - Examples:
     - Insomnia gateway → ISI + DBAS-16 (24 questions)
     - Depression gateway → PHQ-9 (9 questions)
     - OSA risk gateway → Berlin Questionnaire (10 questions)

### Data Structure

Each question includes:
- **Question ID**: Unique identifier
- **Question Text**: Full question as presented to user
- **Pillar**: Which of the 10 Sleep 360° pillars it belongs to
- **Tier**: CORE, EXPANSION, or GATEWAY
- **Scale/Type**: Answer format (e.g., 1-5 scale, multiple choice, numeric)
- **Gateway Trigger**: Condition that triggers expansion (if applicable)
- **Time**: Estimated completion time in minutes
